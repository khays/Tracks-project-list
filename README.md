Tracks-project-list
===================

A python script that creates a markdown file based on your tracks project list from [tracks](http://getontracks.org).

## Why was this created

I have to show my project list to someone, every week. I do everything in tracks, so I wanted a script to make my life easy.

## Python for a ruby application

I found it easier to make this, I don't have a lot of time, and I am new to this sort of thing.
